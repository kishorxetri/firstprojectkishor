<h4 style="color:red;">Master in arts sociology:</h4>
<img src="images/class.jpg" style="width:80%;">
<p>The Master of Arts (M.A. degree) is the most common Master's degree besides the Master of Science (M.Sc.), awarded by most universities worldwide. The study duration of a Master of Arts degree is between 1-2 years, depending on the subject and how intensive classes are.

    Universities and colleges generally award Masters of Arts in fields like Languages, History, Geography, Philosophy, Fine Arts, but also Social Sciences, where they overlap with Masters of Science. This means that one subject can be offered either as an M.A. or an M.Sc. degree depending on which graduate school provides it.
    
    For example, you can find both M.A. and M.Sc. degrees in Political Science. While sometimes the difference is only in name, it can also reflect the focus of classes or the method of graduation. Checking the curriculum is the best way to find out what is expected from you during courses.
    
    Most M.A. classes aim to develop students’ abilities to think critically, analyse ideas and propositions, and express their own conclusions clearly. M.A. degrees usually have a high degree of class interaction. To receive a Master of Arts degree, you need to write a thesis based on independent research during the final year.
